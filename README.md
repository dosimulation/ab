# chpr-plot-service

## 1 Introduction
This project contains source code for a CHPR plotting application for Abbot. This document contains high-level information about this repository as well as set-up and run instructions.

### 1.1 Tech Stack

#### Core

- Python 
- Docker (infrastructure and containerization)
- Django (web framework)
- Postgresql (database)  

#### Secondary

- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Pygal  (plotting)

## 2 Set Up

1. Clone this repository

2. Set up Docker

    Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

    PC: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

3. Build container

    Startup a terminal (Mac) or the docker-toolbox shell (PC), and type in the following commands:

    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

4. Give executing permissions to critical scripts
   
    ```
    sudo chmod +x docker-entrypoint.sh
    sudo chmod +x start_dev_docker
    ```
    
5. Create Admin account for Django Admin (In another terminal (Mac) or the docker-toolbox shell (PC) window)

    ```
    docker-compose run web sh
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
    ... follow prompts to create super user ...
    
    exit
    ```

## 3 Run

Once the container is built, you may run with two methods:

For production and full integration testing:

```
docker-compose up
```

For development and debugging:

```
./start_dev_docker
```

You may now go to http://localhost:8000 with your browser to see the site. Go to /admin for admin panel, and
log in with credentials from 2.5

## 3.1 Quitting

Use Ctrl+C to quit the running server. You may also need to run:

```
docker-compose down
```

To ensure that containers have shut down properly.
